# üèÄ Scoreboard App (Home vs Guest)

A simple, responsive scoreboard built entirely with vanilla (pure) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed to track the scores of two teams and visually display which team is currently leading.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multiple Points:** Add points (1, 2, or 3) for each team.
* **Leader Highlighting:** The team currently in the lead is highlighted with a dashed border.
* **Restart Button:** Function to quickly reset the scoreboard to 0-0.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Clear implementation of updating HTML elements based on JavaScript logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Scoreboard structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout (including an external font for the score display).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** All the logic for counting, display update, and managing the leader team status.

## üí° Development Notes

This project serves as an excellent exercise for practicing fundamental JavaScript concepts, particularly:

* Basic DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById()`, `.innerText`).
* Use of global variables to maintain state (`home`, `guest`).
* Conditional logic (`if/else if/else`) for dynamic CSS style changes.
